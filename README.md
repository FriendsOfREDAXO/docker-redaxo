# Docker community image for REDAXO

Thereâ€™s no official Docker image for REDAXO yet, but this one represents the __Â»officialÂ« community image__. It is developed and maintained by [Friends Of REDAXO](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO).

## Supported tags

Tags follow this scheme: `REDAXO-PHP-Variant`.

* __REDAXO version__ can include major, feature or hotfix releases, such as: `5`, `5.8`, `5.8.1`.
* __PHP versions__: `php7.2`, `php7.3` _(default)_, `php7.4`
* __Variants__: `apache` _(default)_

As a __shorthand__, you can provide just the REDAXO version to use it with the default PHP version (7.3) and the default variant (Apache).

Examples:

* `5.8.1-php7.4-apache`
* `5` ðŸ”¥

A [complete list of tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/friendsofredaxo/redaxo/tags) is available at Docker Hub.
